After ariving on the main page, searching for UFO spotings is easy.  You simply scroll down so that all the fillter options are visible.  Then type in one or more filter options and then the table will populate to the right.  Below is an example of a search for sightings in WI.

## Summery
One of the drawbacks of this website is that, you can search with specific data points, but if you spell a city name or state wrong it wont tell you, there will simply be no output.

Some other features that would be nice on this page would be a drop down and select menu for people who don't have anything spicific in mine and just want to see whats out there.  It would also be great if there was a option to have any photos from the sighting populate below the table after you searched.
